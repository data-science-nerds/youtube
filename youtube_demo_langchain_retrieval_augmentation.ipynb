It was an ally of Great Britain, France, and Russia against the Central Powers. Almost all of Italy\\'s fighting was on the Eastern border, near Austria. After the \"Caporetto defeat\", Italy thought they would lose the war. But, in 1918, the Central Powers surrendered. Italy gained the Trentino-South Tyrol, which once was owned by Austria.\\n\\nFascist Italy \\nIn 1922, a new Italian government started. It was ruled by Benito Mussolini, the leader of Fascism in Italy. He became head of government and dictator, calling himself \"Il Duce\" (which means \"leader\" in Italian). He became friends with German dictator Adolf Hitler. Germany, Japan, and Italy became the Axis Powers. In 1940, they entered World War II together against France, Great Britain, and later the Soviet Union.

The area included a group of separate states that were ruled by other countries (such as Austria, France, and Spain).
